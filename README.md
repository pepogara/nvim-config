# Neovim Config

This is my Neovim configuration, managed with [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/).  
It includes a growing set of plugins for productivity, aesthetics, and development.

Inspired by this [youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn&si=T6-rDh1L6ooP21vT).
